# Current State / Handoff
Date: 2026-10-16
Stage: M0 repository bootstrap.

Decided: Godot 4 + GDScript, one public GitHub repository, GitHub Actions CI, Web build first and Android debug APK target, mobile-first Redmi K70 testing, hybrid direct/guided/autonomous life simulation, private asset separation.

This initial commit is a project skeleton and documentation, NOT a completed playable game. No CI run, APK installation, browser benchmark, morph target rig, licensed Darian mesh or private asset pack is verified by this checkpoint.

Next: inspect CI workflow outcomes; fix any export/SDK configuration; produce minimal playable M1 scene with touch controls. Never mark M0 closed until actual Web and APK artifacts have been checked and a phone runtime test is recorded.

Current risks: Godot version/export template compatibility; Android SDK provisioning on CI; WebGL2 browser performance; absent rigged/morphable character assets; no unauthorized public distribution of private art.

## Research and skills follow-up
2026-10-16: Added 9 task-specific skill contracts, registry, skill execution gate and official-doc research baseline. Existing Godot 4.3 CI is still provisional and unverified; no gameplay implementation or green dual-platform build claimed. Next: engine-version decision, validate CI, repair export workflow, then prototype under selected skills.

## Architecture research checkpoint (2026-10-16)
Added ADR-0001, ADR-0002, character assets assessment and V01–V12 validation matrix. Godot 4.7 stable series is proposed as migration target; exact patch and matching Android toolchain still need CI proof. No third-party model approved; no device test/verified export. Next execution: migrate/pin after checking 4.7 patch assets, then run CI and fix actual failures.
